# eZ Platform Dockerized

> eZ Platform development stack: Nginx, MySQL and PHP-FPM

## What's inside

* [Nginx](http://nginx.org/)
* [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)
* [PHP-FPM](http://php-fpm.org/)

## Requirements

* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/installation/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) (Mac and Windows only)

## Running

Set up a Docker Machine and then run:

```sh

```

That's it! You can now access your configured sites via the IP address of the Docker Machine or locally if you're running a Linux flavour and using Docker natively.
